        <h2> MY FAVOURITE HOBBIES<br><span id="hobby"> Coding </span> </h2>
        <p> I love Coding Because by Coding we can use our own Creativity to design an app or a game! We can can make any app, game or even a webpage! ðŸ’– I have done 45+ Class, Project and Quizzes of WhiteHat Junior.
            They helps me to learn Coding...
            <br>
            I first heard about WhiteHat Junior from a student in my class, Vihaan Bhasharkar. He had the WhiteHat so after asking he told me about this coding class. I found it intriguing, so I asked my father if we could take the trial class and he said yes. At first I wasn't sure about anything but then I found out that my teacher was super nice and I signed up. I'd say the money paid was worth it.ðŸ˜€

        <h2> Painting / Drawing </h2>
        <p> I also like Drawing and painting but I focus more on drawing than painting.ðŸŽ¨ I do not have painting or drawing classes but literally everyone as in my friends, family and relatives think the opposite of the truth. Still, though I'm great at drawing I've never yet been that satisfied with it.
            <br>
            Drawing is not a problem for me but the only thing is that I can't come up with something to draw.ðŸŽ¨ That's why I usually get model images for me to draw them. To sum this paragraph up I'll say that I can't think of any object, animal or person to draw so I use images to make my drawings.

        <h2> Reading </h2>
        <p> I love reading. It helps me calm my mind and that's exactly what I need after a rough day or a long day. ðŸ“–ðŸ“š Reading is very relaxing so I don't need to work hard just to read a simple word, sentence or paragraph. It's very calming and engaging.
            <br>
            I also like reading because it also counts as educational studies. Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. ðŸ“•ðŸ“” Besides, there's a lot of room for grammar and language development. When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time. So that's a win-win for me!

    <section id="contacts">
        <p> In this section I have written all about my contacts and friend
            <br>
            I have many friends like all of you, but one of my closest friend is Anvi. I am very lucky to have a friend like her. She helps me when I am stuck or finding anything difficult and she is great at cheering me up too! So, in short she is the best friend anybody can ever have.

            <br>

            Then comes Ananya. She is my friend too! Both, Anvi and Ananya are my school friends. Now back onto topic! Ananya is very funny. She is also very kind and caring. She loves uncorns and the color pink but I don't both and same goes for Anvi! They are my bestest friends and - oh! I can't believe I forgot about Diti!

            <br>

            She is my friend too! She is one year younger than me but still is very naughty and mischevious, much more than I could ever be. She loves having fun. Diti is the cheerful and charismatic type. Though mischevious, she is also very sweet.

            <br>

            These were the characteristics of my friends.
            <br>
            I have also given my gmail address below.
